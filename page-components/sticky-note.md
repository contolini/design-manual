  You can write on it. You can stick it to a wall (or table, if you're feeling
  wacky). What's not to love?

      When to use


      \    When there is a specific action users may want or need to take that
      requires contacting a specific office within the Bureau.


      \    Default placement should be in the sidebar, use main content area
      when contact information is of extra significance or directly ties into
      the main objective of the page.


      When something else is better


      \    When no contact information is needed or no specific action is tied
      to the contact information.
